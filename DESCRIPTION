Description: Provides reliable, accurate, up-to-date functions to score 
    commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life (QoL), and 
    other psychometric measures.  PROscorer, together with the PROscorerTools 
    package, is a system to facilitate the incorporation of PRO measures into 
    research studies in a scientifically rigorous and reproducible manner.  
    These packages and their vignettes are intended to help establish and 
    promote "best practices" for scoring and describing PRO-like measures in 
    research.  PROscorer is a centralized, extendable repository of accurate, 
    open source scoring functions for commonly used PRO measures and other 
    scored psychometric questionnaires.  The PROscorer "Instrument 
    Descriptions" vignette contains descriptions of each instrument scored by 
    PROscorer, complete with references.  These instrument descriptions are 
    purposefully written to be suitable for inclusion in formal study protocol 
    documents, grant proposals, and manuscript Method sections.  Each 
    PROscorer function is composed of helper functions from the PROscorerTools 
    package, and users are encouraged to contribute new functions to 
    PROscorer.  Just use PROscorerTools to write a scoring function for your 
    favorite PRO measure, and submit it to me (a tutorial will be provided in 
    a forthcoming vignette for the PROscorerTools package).  After extensive 
    accuracy checks, it can be included in future versions of the PROscorer 
    package.  Scoring procedures represent a major source of error in research 
    studies that rely upon PRO and similar measures.  These errors typically 
    go unnoticed, hidden, and/or ignored, eroding the scientific integrity of 
    the research and hindering progress in the numerous scientific fields that 
    conduct studies that use these measures.  One small scoring error can 
    severely compromise measurement validity and reliability, as well as make 
    research results impossible to reproduce and replicate.  The lofty goal of 
    the PROscorer package is to eliminate this serious deficiency in PRO-
    based research by serving as the gold-standard repository of scoring 
    syntax for PRO-like measures commonly used in research.  Eventually, use 
    of PROscorer to score outcome measures should be a basic requirement for a 
    study to be funded and its results published (in my humble opinion).  The
    current version is still somewhat developmental, since the formal unit 
    testing system is not yet in place.  Please use with caution at this time, 
    and feel free to contact me with questions or suggestions.
