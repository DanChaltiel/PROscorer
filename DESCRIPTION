Description: An extendable repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to score 
    commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life (QoL), and 
    other psychometric and psychological measures.  'PROscorer', together with 
    the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system to facilitate the incorporation of 
    PRO measures into research studies and clinical settings in a scientifically 
    rigorous and reproducible manner.  These packages and their vignettes are 
    intended to help establish and promote "best practices" to improve the 
    planning, scoring, and reporting of PRO-like measures in research.  
    The 'PROscorer' "Instrument Descriptions" vignette contains descriptions of 
    each instrument scored by 'PROscorer', complete with references.  These 
    instrument descriptions are written according to specific guidelines to be 
    suitable for inclusion in formal study protocol documents, grant proposals, 
    and manuscript Method sections.  Each 'PROscorer' function is composed of 
    helper functions from the 'PROscorerTools' package, and users are 
    encouraged to contribute new functions to 'PROscorer'.  Scoring procedures 
    represent a major source of error and inconsistency in research studies that 
    rely upon PRO and similar measures.  Relatively minor scoring errors can 
    compromise measurement validity and reliability, as well as make research 
    results impossible to reproduce and replicate.  These errors typically go 
    unnoticed, hidden, and/or ignored, eroding the scientific integrity of the 
    research and hindering progress in the numerous scientific fields that 
    conduct studies that use these measures.  The goals of the 'PROscorer' and 
    'PROscorerTools' packages are to draw attention to scoring and reporting 
    best-practices and to help eliminate inaccurate and inconsistent scoring.  
    The current version is still somewhat developmental, since the formal unit 
    testing system is not yet in place.  Please use with caution at this time, 
    and feel free to contact me with questions or suggestions.  More scoring 
    functions are currently in development and will be added in future updates.
