Description: An extensible repository of accurate, up-to-date functions to score 
    commonly used patient-reported outcome (PRO), quality of life (QoL), and 
    other psychometric and psychological measures.  'PROscorer', together with 
    the 'PROscorerTools' package, is a system to facilitate the incorporation of 
    PRO measures into research studies and clinical settings in a scientifically 
    rigorous and reproducible manner.  These packages and their vignettes are 
    intended to help establish and promote "best practices" to improve the 
    planning, scoring, and reporting of PRO-like measures in research.  
    The 'PROscorer' "Instrument Descriptions" vignette contains descriptions of 
    each instrument scored by 'PROscorer', complete with references.  These 
    instrument descriptions are written according to specific guidelines to be 
    suitable for inclusion in formal study protocol documents, grant proposals, 
    and manuscript Method sections.  Each 'PROscorer' function is composed of 
    helper functions from the 'PROscorerTools' package, and users are 
    encouraged to contribute new functions to 'PROscorer'.  The goals of the 
    'PROscorer' and 'PROscorerTools' packages are to draw attention to scoring 
    and reporting best-practices and to help eliminate inaccurate and 
    inconsistent scoring.  Feel free to contact me with questions or 
    suggestions.  More scoring functions are currently in development and will
    be added in future updates.
